    <h1>This is us!</h1>
        <p>Nestled in the heart of the city, Brewhaven Caf√© started as a small, family-owned coffee shop with a passion for ethically sourced beans and expertly crafted brews. Since opening in 2010, it has grown into a beloved community hub where locals gather for rich espresso, cozy ambiance, and warm conversations.</p>
        <p>Committed to sustainability, Brewhaven partners with fair-trade farmers and uses eco-friendly packaging. Whether you're here for a morning pick-me-up or a quiet place to work, every cup tells a story of quality, care, and connection.</p>
